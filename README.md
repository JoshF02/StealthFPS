A personal project inspired by Hitman and Mosa Lina - a stealth FPS made in Unity with a focus on replayability, achieved using a combination of handcrafted levels and mechanics with randomisation of what 
tools and objectives the player is given each playthrough. 

Key Development Aspects:
- AI - actions, decisions and responses
- Player detection systems - visual, audio simulation, enemy communication
- Gadgets, tools and other player mechanics
- Scoring, randomisation and replayability
- Level design
- Menus, UI and user experience
- Visuals and polish
- Testing and optimisation

Currently developing a vertical slice - 1 level with a small selection of gadgets and tools, to show and test the general gameplay and systems I am implementing.
